# ESP32-S3 LVGL Yet Another Stock Price Tracker

A demo project for ESP32-S3 using [LVGL](https://lvgl.io/) to display real-time stock prices with WiFi configuration and persistent storage.

Most other ESP32 stock price tracker projects require registering for an API account to fetch stock prices.

For me, I wanted a simple implementation. So I found a usable API from Yahoo, which may be blocked in the future, but works for now...


## Project Core Values

- For learning purposes.
- The implementation is kept simple and straightforward.
- No fancy stuff, just make it work.

## Things that this project can help you

Around 80% of the code is generated by AI. The most time-consuming task was finding a proper and simple API to get the stock price.

If you need a simple and straightforward API, please check `get_stock_price_all_yahoo()` in `appController.cpp`.

## Features

- ESP32-S3 + LVGL GUI v9.1
- WiFi configuration (SSID/Password)
- Stock price fetching from Yahoo Finance
- Persistent storage (NVS)
- Software reset and storage reset
- Responsive UI with FreeRTOS tasks

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- VS Code with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) extension
- ESP32-S3 board + 2.8" TFT LCD
    - The hardware was purchased from Taobao. Hardware info: [ESP32-LVGL开发板](http://wiki.waaax.cn/boards/ESP32/ESP32-LVGL%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E6%9D%BF.html)
    > **Note:** It is not recommended to buy this dev board. It has some hardware issues and may reset automatically, especially when connected to a PC.
    - Using ESP32-S3-N8R8
    - LCD Driver: ST7989, 320 x 240 pixels
    - Touch Driver: XPT2046  


### Building & Flashing

1. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    ```

2. Open the project in PlatformIO.

3. Build and upload to your ESP32-S3 board.

### Usage

- On first boot, configure WiFi via the GUI.
- Press "Update" to fetch stock prices.
- Use the AP Settings tab to change WiFi credentials.
- Use the Reset button to clear storage and reboot.

## File Structure

```
lib/
  appController/      # Main application logic
  stockPrice/         # GUI and stock price logic
  storage/            # Persistent storage (NVS)
src/
  main.cpp            # Entry point
```

## Customization

- Edit `s_Symbols` in `stock_price_gui.cpp` to change the tracked stocks.


## Future Plans

- Multi-language support (English/Chinese)
- Add color themes
- Update the Arduino framework (currently using IDF v4.4)
- Create a database and save to SD card; display charts on screen
- Many areas can be further optimized...
